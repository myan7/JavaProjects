/*
Given a string s, return the length of the longest repeating substrings.
If no repeating substring exists, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no repeating substring.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abbaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest repeating substrings are "ab" and "ba", each of which occurs twice.

Example 3:
Input: s = "aabcaabdaab"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aab", which occurs 3 times.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lowercase English letters.
